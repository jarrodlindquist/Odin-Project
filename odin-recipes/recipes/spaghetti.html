    <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It‚Äôs perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours! Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!</p>

    <!-- Instructions for recipe -->
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Saut√© ‚Äì Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
        <li>Cook beef ‚Äì Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
        <li>Reduce wine ‚Äì Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Simmer ‚Äì Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 ‚Äì 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
        <li>Taste and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti ‚Äì though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tossing sauce and spaghetti (optional)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 ‚Äì 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
