    <!-- Instructions for recipe -->
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Ragu</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
        <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
        <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
        <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
